I came to Melbourne in 2008 to study a degree in Software Engineering. Unlike several of my other peers who had dreams of working at FAANG companies, I didn't really know what I wanted to do. Upon graduating, I found a job at a start up called Outware Mobile, a newly established consulting firm that was set to ride the mobile app boom. Now, more than 10 years later, I'm still hustling and building mobile apps every day. Currently lead developering at [REA Group](https://rea-group.com).
